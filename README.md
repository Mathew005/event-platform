# CFC - College Fest Central Frontend

## Description

CFC (College Fest Central) is a platform and management system designed for the creation, management, and publication of college events and fests. This web application allows two types of users:

- **Organizer**: Can create, manage, and publish events or programs.
- **Participant**: Can filter and view events and programs.

This is a **crude implementation** using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The platform consists of several pages, including login/register pages, dashboards, event creation, and registration analytics. Participants can also download analytics in XLSX and PDF formats.

Some underused features, such as **interests**, can be easily implemented in the future.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- A working backend (for proper data handling) â€“ You can find the backend repository [here](https://github.com/Mathew005/cfc).
